# N-Restaurant Project

## About the Project

**N-Restaurant** is a dynamic desktop view only  interactive restaurant website built using only **HTML**, **CSS**. The website showcases a fictional restaurant, offering users an immersive experience where they can explore the menu, view restaurant details, and make reservations. The goal of this project is to provide a modern, user-friendly interface that simulates a real-world restaurant platform, highlighting both design and functionality.

## Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Users can browse the restaurant’s menu with filtering options by meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
- **Reservation System**: A functional form for users to make table reservations.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Restaurant Details**: Information about the restaurant, including location, opening hours, and contact information.

## Personal Motivation

The **N-Restaurant** project was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my skills in **front-end development**, specifically focusing on creating visually engaging and interactive websites using core technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. As someone passionate about building intuitive user experiences, I wanted to push myself to design a website that not only looks good but also functions smoothly with seamless interactions. This project allowed me to practice working with forms, implementing client-side validation, and using **JavaScript** to manage dynamic content.

Creating a restaurant website also gave me the chance to combine **UI/UX principles** with **functionality** to deliver a complete experience—from browsing the menu to booking a reservation—making it both a fun and rewarding challenge.
